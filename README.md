# MIPS Assembly Image Processor

This project is an **image procesor** written in MIPS Assembly Language. The project performs various tasks, including **image thresholding, matrix transformation, and image cryptography**. 

## How to Run Code

1. Have MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) downloaded
2. Have the `lenna.pgm` file as well as MARS in the same directory
3. Sheared, transformed, and altered images will populate the same directory post-execute
